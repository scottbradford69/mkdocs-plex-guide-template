# I'm having a problem with a Movie or TV Show

If you encounter any problems with content (such as distorted video, incorrect media, double images, or misaligned subtitles), you have two ways to report it:

## Using Overseerr (Preferred Method)

   1. Visit [{{ request_url }}](https://{{ request_url }})
   2. Find the problematic Movie or TV Show
   3. Click the yellow exclamation point icon in the top right
   4. Enter the details of the issue

   While this method isn't required, it helps me track and resolve issues more effectively by creating a searchable history of reported problems.
